# chromium-sync-proto
This is a shallow fork of the Chromium repo containing the definitions
of its sync protocol, and any related files.

## Why?
The Chromium repo is huge and takes several hours to clone tens of GBs
of code history.

We want the sync protocol definitions, and its corresponding history, so
pulling everything else all of the time is a waste of time/space.
